    <h2>
        <span style="color: #ff0000;">[EDIT: 2010/01/10] In the case you are running an x86
            Windows; you are greatly advised to upgrade to Hawkeye 1.2.5: the previous release
            is broken on these OS.</span></h2>
    <p>
        I apologize for the inconvenience, but it appears Hawkeye 1.2.4 (and probably previous
        versions) doesn't run properly on x86 Windows (See issue <a title="#7791" href="http://hawkeye.codeplex.com/workitem/7791">
            #7791</a>). <a title="Hawkeye 1.2.5" href="http://hawkeye.codeplex.com/releases/view/58898">
                Hawkeye 1.2.5</a> fixes this issue.</p>
    <h1>
        Project Description</h1>
    <p>
        Debugging a managed Windows application is, most of the time, not an easy task.
        Thus, any tool that can help will make your life easier.</p>
    <p>
        Hawkeye is the only .Net tool that allows you to view, edit, analyze and invoke
        (almost) any object from a .Net application. Whenever you try to debug, test, change
        or understand an application, Hawkeye can help.</p>
    <p>
        With a unique option to Attach to any running .Net process, Hawkeye offers an impressive
        set of functionalities seen in no other product.</p>
    <h1>
        Features</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Attach to any .Net Process.
            <ol>
                <li>Hawkeye can be injected in any .NET process allowing you to easily hook and modify
                    other processes. </li>
                <li>You can even hook into Visual Studio and modify some of its (.NET) properties (E.g.:
                    the Properties Editor from VS). </li>
                <li>Since version 1.1.9, Hawkeye has support for 64bit so you can now attach Hawkeye
                    to any x86 or x64 process. </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>A properties editor like the VS editor that can be used to change the properties
            of any object or control at runtime. </li>
        <li>Shows you <strong>all the properties that are defined on an object</strong> (even
            if they are not normally visible in the designer). </li>
        <li>Shows you <strong>all the fields of an object</strong> organized by the class in
            the hierarchy that owns that property. </li>
        <li>Shows <strong>all the methods of an object</strong> organized by the class and visibility
            of the method.
            <ol>
                <li>Provides a simple way to invoke methods on objects and pass arguments on any method
                    (public, private ...). </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Shows you <strong>all the events defined on an object</strong> and <strong>all the
            event listeners registered</strong> to listen to a specific event (e.g.:&nbsp;<span
                style="font-family: Consolas,'Courier New',Courier,monospace; white-space: pre;">Form_Load</span>).
            <ol>
                <li>You can even Invoke an event listener. </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Shows process information including static information about <span class="codeInline">
            Application</span>, <span class="codeInline">CurrentContext</span>, <span class="codeInline">
                CurrentThread</span>, <span class="codeInline">CurrentPrincipal</span>, <span class="codeInline">
                    CurrentProcess</span>, and garbage collection. </li>
        <li>Supports back/forward navigation between the last edited objects, and supports navigation
            to child items in collections, enumerations or arrays (E.g.: the Controls collection
            of a Control). </li>
        <li>Changes that you do to the code can be logged as C# code that can be just Copy&amp;Pasted
            back into code. </li>
        <li>How about "Show Source Code"?
            <ol>
                <li>You just started in a new project and you don't know where to start? Select your
                    element, open <a title=".NET Reflector" href="http://reflector.red-gate.com/download.aspx">
                        Red Gate's .NET Reflector</a> (formerly Lutz Roeder's .NET Reflector) and select
                    Show source code. Hawkeye will immediately ask Reflector to show you the source
                    code of the selected element being it a field, property, event, method or class.
                </li>
